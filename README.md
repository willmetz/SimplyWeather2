SimplyWeather2
## Getting Started

In order to run this application you will need to create a file named AppConfig with the following:<br /><br />

public const String OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY = "";<br />
public const String MAPBOX_API_KEY = "";<br />

These keys will need to be populated with keys created from the following sources (don't worry this is all free):<br />
[Open Weather](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in)<br />
[Map Box](https://account.mapbox.com/)<br />

These API's are used to get weather and map information show in the app.
